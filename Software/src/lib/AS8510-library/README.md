# AS8510-library
Library for the AS8510 Data acquisition device for battery sensors

Key Features:
I'll search for information about the AS8510 IC chip to understand its specifications and see if there are existing libraries available.Let me search more specifically for Arduino libraries and example code for the AS8510:Let me fetch the AMS official page to get more details about available resources:Based on my research, the AS8510 is a high-precision data acquisition front-end IC from AMS (now ams-osram) designed for battery management applications. AMS mentions that libraries for Arduino IDE and example code are available as downloads, but I couldn't find a publicly available, ready-to-use Arduino library on GitHub or other common repositories.

Since there doesn't appear to be a widely available public library, I can create a basic Arduino library for the AS8510 based on its specifications. The AS8510 is a virtually offset-free, low noise, 2-channel measurement device designed to accurately measure battery current from mA to kA range using a 100 µOhm shunt resistor.

Let me create a basic Arduino library for the AS8510:I've created a comprehensive Arduino library for the AS8510 IC chip. This library provides:

**Key Features:**
- SPI communication interface
- Configurable PGA (Programmable Gain Amplifier) settings for both channels
- Multiple sample rate options (125 SPS to 4000 SPS)
- Current and voltage measurement functions
- Power calculation
- Continuous and single-shot measurement modes

**Main Functions:**
- `begin()` - Initialize the device
- `readCurrent()` - Read current from shunt resistor
- `readVoltage()` - Read voltage measurements
- `readPower()` - Calculate power consumption
- `setPGAGain()` - Configure amplifier gain per channel
- `setSampleRate()` - Set ADC sample rate

**Important Notes:**
1. This library is based on typical specifications for the AS8510 and common SPI interface patterns
2. You'll need to verify the actual register addresses and bit mappings against the official AS8510 datasheet
3. The default shunt resistance is set to 100µΩ as mentioned in the specifications
4. The library assumes a 3.3V reference voltage - adjust if your setup differs

**To use this library:**
1. Save the code as `AS8510.h` in your Arduino libraries folder
2. Include it in your sketch with `#include "AS8510.h"`
3. Create an instance with your CS pin and shunt resistance value
4. Call `begin()` to initialize, then use the measurement functions

Since I couldn't find an official public library, I recommend also checking the AMS/ams-osram website directly for any official libraries or example code that might be available through their support channels or development kits.
